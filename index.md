## Values

Be nice to people, it goes a long way. We don't know where each of us have been in our pasts, so start off nice and you may have a friend forever.

## Personality

You will find I am more reserved and gun shy.
Until I get to know and learn our limits together, then you might find I am a complete goof ball :)

## Receiving Feedback & Recognition

How do you best receive feedback, be it positive or negative?

What about when one of us wants to call you out in some way for something awesome you did, a
great piece of advice you gave, an insight you had, or your amazing Cat Thursday shirt—how do
you feel most comfortable receiving that recognition?

## Work Patterns

What hours do you usually work?
My working hours are changing, lol. Pre-COVID, I used to start work at 7AM EST. Now, being remote has changed that. I find myself starting my day much later in the morning, 10am EST (and I think working at Pantheon will make it start even later, thanks PST!).

When do you prefer to work alone, versus in groups? How do your energy levels fluctuate through-
out the day?
I prefer to have split time working alone and in groups. Alone work is important for reflection. I find I have to remind myself to colloborate more.

## Communication Preferences

Generally, if I see your message, I will respond as soon as I can. If I do not, I am not ignoring you. The best way to reach me is a mention or DM in Slack.

## How To Know I’ve Gone To The Dark Side

### Warning Signs

When you don't feel safe in a conversation, how does this manifest itself in your actions or affects?
What about when you're just not having an "on" or "good" day?

### How to help

This might also be a good place
to present recommendations for how we can be supportive towards you when you've gone to the
Dark Side.

## Areas for Development

I always need help being more outgoing and expressive.

## Ask Me About

Talk to me about cats, I have 5!
